The bolded works are the same as what you see used in the report graphics.

There are 4 guidelines to win your snake draft:
1. Draft your offensive starting lineup first before drafting bench players.  Save Kickers and Defenses for later rounds because they are less predictable and score fewer points.
2. For starters, pick the player with the highest value VOR (over a typical replacement) who has a low risk and a high floor.  Bench players only benefit your team if a starter gets injured or they outperform a starter.  In a standard league, 1500 points would likely put you in the top 10% of teams.  Your goal is thus to maximize your starting lineup’s projected points.
3. For bench players, pick the player with the highest value VOR  (over a typical replacement) who has a high ceiling.  That way, one or more of your bench players has a chance to outperform your starters or be a solid replacement if your starters get injured.  You should be willing to accept a higher risk for bench players than for starters.
4. Give players more weight if they have either:
o a high dropoff (the player is projected to score many more points than the next best players at the same position), or
o a high ADP Difference score (ADPD) (i.e., the player tends to be under-valued compared to ADP and you might be able to draft him in a later round).
